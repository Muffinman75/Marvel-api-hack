From the landing page the user will select a charcter they wish to know more
about. They will then be presented with a full size picture of the chosen 
character and some text about the origin/history of the character. Below this there
will be a selection of four videos from youtube also on the origin/history of the 
character, which is displayed in a lightbox. Underneath the video section is a shopping 
results area pulled in from ebay to display 6 items and their titles which are also related
to the chosen character. There is a flashing green button at the top of the page which navigates
back to the character selection screen, the button also appears at the bottom of the page 
providing shopping results are present.
